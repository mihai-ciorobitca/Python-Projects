Welcome to the TelegramBot repository, where we bring you cool and useful Telegram automation scripts!

# Tele Reminder üìÖ
Never forget to stay hydrated with Tele Reminder! This nifty script sends gentle reminders to drink water directly to your private Telegram group. The magic happens on PythonAnywhere, where a scheduled task runs the script every hour at your specified minute. Simply create a PythonAnywhere account, set up a programmatic task, and let the Telegram library work its wonders with your bot TOKEN.

# Tele Weather ‚òÄÔ∏è
Get instant weather updates with Tele Weather! This interactive bot allows you to send commands and receive weather information based on city queries.
